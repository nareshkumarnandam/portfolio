                Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Naresh Kumar Nandam and I'm from Hyderabad, Telangana, India. As a Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic design isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I work on.

                    Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages and I currently speak four of them fluently. I believe that this skill has given me a unique perspective and allows me to communicate effectively with clients from all over the world. One of my strengths is adding a personal touch to my projects by adding the client's identity and message into the design, creating meaningful and beautiful end products that are both eye-catching and user-friendly.

                    In my free time, I enjoy exploring my other passions, such as photography and music production, which provide me with creative outlets. I am also very passionate about Web3 and everything related to crypto, NFTs and blockchain technology as I believe they have the potential to revolutionize business and online interactions.
